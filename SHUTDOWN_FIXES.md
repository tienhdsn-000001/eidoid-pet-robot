# Alexa Sleep Cycle and Shutdown Cooldown Fixes

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **Extended Cooldown Period**
**Problem**: Alexa was being triggered immediately after Jarvis shutdown because the cooldown was only 1 second.

**Solution**: 
- Increased `POST_SESSION_COOLDOWN_S` from `1.0` to `5.0` seconds
- Added logging to show cooldown period remaining
- This prevents immediate wake word detection after shutdown

**File Modified**: `config.py`
```python
POST_SESSION_COOLDOWN_S = 5.0  # Was 1.0
```

### 2. **LED State Management During Shutdown**
**Problem**: LEDs were not being turned off immediately when shutdown was called, causing visual confusion.

**Solution**:
- Added immediate LED turn-off when `shutdown_robot` tool is called
- Added LED turn-off when shutdown phrase is detected in transcription
- Ensured LEDs are off before state reset in main loop

**Files Modified**: 
- `session_manager.py`: Added LED control in shutdown tool handler and phrase detection
- `main.py`: Moved LED turn-off before state reset

### 3. **Improved Shutdown Flow**
**Problem**: The shutdown process wasn't clean and could leave the robot in an inconsistent state.

**Solution**:
- LEDs turn off immediately when shutdown is triggered
- State is properly set to SLEEPING
- Cooldown period prevents immediate re-triggering
- Clear logging shows the shutdown process

## Current Shutdown Behavior

### When "Thank you for your time" is said:
1. **Immediate**: LEDs turn OFF
2. **State Change**: Robot state set to SLEEPING
3. **Session End**: Session closes with reason "shutdown_to_sleep"
4. **Cooldown**: 5-second period before wake word listening resumes
5. **Logging**: Clear indication of cooldown period remaining

### When `shutdown_robot` tool is called:
1. **Immediate**: LEDs turn OFF
2. **State Change**: Robot state set to SLEEPING
3. **Session End**: Session closes with reason "shutdown_to_sleep"
4. **Cooldown**: 5-second period before wake word listening resumes

## Wake Word Listener Improvements

### Cooldown Display
The wake word listener now shows:
```
[WAKE_WORD] Cooldown period: 4.2s remaining...
[WAKE_WORD] Cooldown period: 3.1s remaining...
[WAKE_WORD] Cooldown period: 2.0s remaining...
[WAKE_WORD] Cooldown period: 0.9s remaining...
[WAKE_WORD] Listening for: Hey Jarvis, Alexa, Weather
```

### LED States During Shutdown
- **Before Shutdown**: LEDs pulsing (listening) or solid (speaking)
- **Shutdown Triggered**: LEDs immediately turn OFF
- **During Cooldown**: LEDs remain OFF
- **After Cooldown**: LEDs remain OFF (sleep state)

## Testing the Fix

To test the improved shutdown behavior:

1. **Start the robot**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/eidoid-pet-robot-cursor-integrate-firestore-for-persistent-chat-memory-99b0
   source .venv/bin/activate
   export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/eidoid-1-35368aeb6c49.json"
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   python3 main.py
   ```

2. **Test shutdown**:
   - Say "Hey Jarvis" to activate Jarvis
   - Have a conversation
   - Say "Thank you for your time"
   - Observe: LEDs turn off immediately
   - Wait: 5-second cooldown period
   - Try saying "Alexa" immediately - should not trigger
   - After cooldown: "Alexa" should work normally

## Expected Behavior Now

✅ **LEDs turn off immediately** when shutdown is called
✅ **5-second cooldown** prevents immediate re-triggering
✅ **Clear logging** shows shutdown process and cooldown
✅ **Clean state transitions** from active to sleep
✅ **No more Alexa auto-triggering** after Jarvis shutdown

The robot should now properly return to sleep after shutdown and respect the cooldown period before accepting new wake words.
