# Eidoid Pet Robot - Firestore Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed âœ…

### 1. LED System Control
**Problem**: LEDs were not being controlled properly during different robot states.

**Solution**: 
- Added LED control in `main.py`:
  - LEDs turn OFF during sleep state
  - LEDs start PULSING when waking up
  - LEDs turn OFF when session ends
- Added LED control in `session_manager.py`:
  - LEDs turn ON (solid) when assistant is speaking
  - LEDs return to PULSING when assistant stops speaking

**Files Modified**:
- `main.py`: Added LED control for sleep/wake states
- `session_manager.py`: Added LED control during conversation

### 2. Firestore Memory Persistence
**Problem**: Messages were not persisting between sessions because each session used a new UUID.

**Solution**:
- Changed from random UUIDs to persistent session IDs
- Main session uses: `"eidoid-main-session"`
- Persona-specific sessions use: `"eidoid-{persona}-session"`

**Files Modified**:
- `main.py`: Use persistent session ID instead of random UUID
- `firestore_memory.py`: Added persona-specific session ID support

### 3. Separate Memory Stacks for Personas
**Problem**: Alexa and Jarvis were sharing the same memory stack.

**Solution**:
- Implemented persona-specific Firestore sessions
- Each persona gets its own conversation history
- Session IDs: `eidoid-jarvis-session`, `eidoid-alexa-session`, etc.

**Files Modified**:
- `firestore_memory.py`: Added `persona_key` parameter to `initialize_firestore_memory()`
- `state.py`: Initialize persona-specific Firestore memory when switching personas

### 4. Google Cloud Console Setup Verification
**Problem**: Unclear if Firestore was properly configured.

**Solution**:
- Created `check_firestore_setup.py` script to verify:
  - Environment variables are set correctly
  - Service account file exists and is valid
  - Firestore client can connect
  - Basic read/write operations work
  - Main collection is accessible

**Result**: âœ… All Firestore operations working correctly

## Current LED Behavior

### Sleep State
- LEDs: **OFF**
- Robot is listening for wake words

### Wake State (Listening)
- LEDs: **PULSING**
- Robot is ready to receive voice input

### Assistant Speaking
- LEDs: **ON (Solid)**
- Robot is generating and playing audio response

### Session End
- LEDs: **OFF**
- Robot returns to sleep state

## Firestore Memory Structure

### Session Organization
- **Main Session**: `eidoid-main-session` (for concierge personas)
- **Jarvis Session**: `eidoid-jarvis-session` (persistent Jarvis memory)
- **Alexa Session**: `eidoid-alexa-session` (persistent Alexa memory)
- **Custom Personas**: `eidoid-{persona}-session` (for user-created personas)

### Data Storage
- Collection: `(default)` (as configured in `config.py`)
- Each session maintains its own conversation history
- Messages are automatically saved when added via `state.add_user_utt()` and `state.add_assistant_utt()`

## Google Cloud Console Requirements

### âœ… Verified Working
1. **Project**: `eidoid-1` exists and is accessible
2. **Firestore**: Enabled and working correctly
3. **Service Account**: `gemini-chat-service@eidoid-1.iam.gserviceaccount.com` has proper permissions
4. **Billing**: Enabled (required for Firestore)

### Required Permissions
The service account needs the following roles:
- **Cloud Datastore User** (for Firestore read/write)
- **Firebase Admin** (if using Firebase features)

## Testing Results

### Firestore Integration Test
```
âœ… Environment variables set
âœ… Firestore memory initialized
âœ… Messages added to Firestore
âœ… Messages retrieved successfully
âœ… All tests passed!
```

### Firestore Setup Check
```
âœ… Environment variables set
âœ… Service account file found
âœ… Firestore client initialized
âœ… Test document written successfully
âœ… Test document read successfully
âœ… Main collection '(default)' is accessible
ðŸŽ‰ Firestore setup is working correctly!
```

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for use with:
1. **Persistent Memory**: Conversations are saved and persist between sessions
2. **Persona-Specific Memory**: Alexa and Jarvis maintain separate conversation histories
3. **LED Feedback**: Visual indication of robot state (sleep/listening/speaking)
4. **Reliable Storage**: All messages are automatically saved to Firestore

## Usage

To run the robot with all fixes:
```bash
cd /path/to/eidoid-pet-robot-cursor-integrate-firestore-for-persistent-chat-memory-99b0
source .venv/bin/activate
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/eidoid-1-35368aeb6c49.json"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
python3 main.py
```

The robot will now:
- Turn LEDs off during sleep
- Pulse LEDs while listening
- Turn LEDs solid while speaking
- Save all conversations to Firestore
- Maintain separate memory for each persona
- Persist conversations between sessions
